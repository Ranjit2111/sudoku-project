The continue game option continues from where the user left off, but the game cannot differentiate between the values entered by user and the values originally generated by the game. 
So when hints or solve is clicked, the game will throw errors such that it cannot solve. 

So either the user should have entered the values correctly during the previous login or else the game should be able to differentiate user entered and original values, so as to tell the user that their values are wrong.
